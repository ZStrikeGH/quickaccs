# Important Message
quickaccs is now under new ownership, as the creator and previous owner was demanded to take down the [Holy Unblocker](https://bubble.imfrost.cf) and quickaccs by their school administration. After hearing this, I asked if I could continue it, and he agreed to the idea.

## Future Intentions
I plan to improve this page with the help of everyone who uses it, if you would like to help improve quickaccs, please [take a look here](https://github.com/bvoid82/quickaccs/wiki/Contributing,-Suggestions,-and-Feedback)
